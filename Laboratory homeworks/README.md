## 1st Homework

**analogRGBControl**: RGB Led that is controlled using 3 potentiometers (1 for red, 1 for green and 1 for blue).

## 2nd Homework

**knockDetectorBuzzer**: Piezo Buzzer that detects knocks over a specified threshold, and plays a sound after 5 seconds which can be stopped by pressing a pushdown button.

## 3rd Homework

**joystickControlled4digit7segment**: 4 digit 7 segments display that is controlled using a joystick. By moving the joystick left or right, you can choose which digit you want to change. By pressing the joystick button, you enter a changing mode, where you can no longer change the digit, but you can change the value of the selected digit by moving the joystick up or down. To return to changing the digit, you press the button again.

## 4th Homework

**gameMainMenu**: Game menu that will be used for the future game-project. It has "Start" (which starts the game, and for demonstrative purposes, after 5 seconds the score increases and after 10 seconds it displays "Game Over"), "Settings" (here you can change the starting level and I will have to implement changing the name), "Highscore" (displays the highest score achieved, and the person who achieved it. It is stored in EEPROM, so the highscore persists even if the Arduino is restarted), "Exit" (exits the game). [Link to video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnXCR47r3o0)
